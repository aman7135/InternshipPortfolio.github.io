                           Every day we start with a Daily Stand-up where we discuss our progress from the day before and show what we will be doing today. The purpose of this meeting is to keep each other informed about what we are doing and to keep each other on their toes. If someone notices that someone has been working on a certain part for too long, we can hold each other accountable and see what the cause is, and whether we can help each other.At the start of the internship period, we documented every daily stand-up in a Cloud file, but we stopped after a few weeks as we noticed that we were more concerned with writing down your own activities than listening to what others had to say. On days when we were obliged to work from home, these stand-up meetings took place via Microsoft Teams

                          Every Monday morning at 10:30 am we have a week start with the entire PSV Dynamic Audio team from Greenhouse. In it, we discuss last week's progress and what we plan to do this week.The advantage of these types of meetings is that you have a fixed moment to present your progress to your internship and project supervisor. Especially now with the home working situation, it is nice to know where we stand from each other and yet to stay in touch. These meetings are also useful for receiving timely feedback.

                            <li>To Do</li>

                        <p style="color:black;font-size:16px">We have opted for a digital SCRUM board in Trello, as we work from home more than half the time, and it is inconvenient if we can only see / adjust the SCRUM board on office days. I personally like working with a SCRUM Board because you visualize where you are in the project, what still needs to be done, and what has already been done.</p>
