                    Before Starting my internship I told myself that I want to develop on a professional and technical front, those were my main priorities to work on. When I choose this project I knew there will be a lot of communication involved with different parties which was exactly the case. I was very much focused on the process as well as the end result, I got enough opportunity to develop myself on my priorities.
                        <br><br>
                    The way of working in the project was the best thing, I really enjoyed the process. We made a good communication strategy at the start and our Team leader backed us on that, then we never looked backwards and things started to run flawlessly. One thing I would like to change about the process is to maybe include my school teacher more into the process, as I only saw him 3-4 times during the internship, It would have been nicer if I planned him in a few of my week starts or client meetings. 
                    <br><br>
                    First two months I was busy with research whether its brand research or technology research, I encountered a lot of new technologies some of them were impressive and influenced me to work harder to create something like that. I did not really enjoyed the research phase as we end up not using most of the thing we encountered with, But it was a very good learning curve and helped me advise Greenhouse and PSV on Dynamic audio solutions. All in all it was one of the most important phases of the project and helped me create a solid base. 
                    <br><br>
                    Concepting part was a bit tricky as we lack in technology and PSV had way higher expectations than we imagined. It became very difficult to come to an agreement which cost us a lot of time and we had to delay the development phase because of that. I did came up with nice ideas in brainstorm sessions, I was very active within the team to discuss the concepts and to clear confusions if any. My input was good within the team to draw conclusions on a particular concept. Dealing with our client taught me two things: a) Never agrees to everything the client ask for, b) Keep you deadlines/milestones clear with the client, which I consider an improvement on the professional front, this is one of the baits of working in a real time environment, with real clients, things were way different here than a normal school project.
                    <br><br>
                    Then came the phase I was waiting for, even though I did create some prototypes from the start of my internship, it was not an actual project I was just busy building proof of concept for the client so that they can make a decision. All the technical stuff like designing software, sprint planning, milestones and everything was set in this phase. I did an adequate job in building the final prototype in the short period of time. I learned new things and technologies during the project which was one of my priorities. I am looking forward to continue improving on these skills as they will be beneficial in my future. I believe I have given my best during the internship, I would love to implement this in real time but I do not have enough time to continue as I finish my internship this month in Jan 2021. I still enjoyed the work I did and looking forward to present a cool demo in my final presentation.
                    <br><br>

                    Learning process was one of the best I have ever experienced in a project, I would like to thank my team leader Tim he really encouraged me and my team throughout the project. There was a point when all of us were disappointed as we could not come to an agreement with PSV and they keep discarding our ideas, He told us that it is normal for real clients to behave this way and it happens in projects, also he motivated us to keep going and finish it as much as we can and he assured us that he will hire new interns to finish what we left. I had one on one meeting on a regular basis and maintained a good communication with not only people involved in the project but also other LABS interns. 

                    <br><br>
                    Overall, I liked the project, the process and the company. If i get another opportunity I would love to work at greenhouse. As a student I think I had adequate amount of learnings to take from this internship. Some things I heard from my peers that I should improve on, I will make sure I work on those minor details in my next internship. Also I will make sure that I keep my deadlines strict even with the client so that the delay does not happen and I get enough time to develop what I actually want to develop. 
                    <br><br>
                    I have a lot of positives and some negatives to take from this Internship, for the time being I will focus in the positives and work on the negatives in background so that they completely disappear in my graduation.
