                           In the first two weeks greenhouse gave me the opportunity to do a thorough analysis of the problem that PSV is facing, My team leader organized a situation complication workshop and then we worked on analyzing the problems and later presented the finding to other interns at the company. click on the button below to look at the situation complication Document. 
                           <br> Also we did a lot of problem analysis sessions together as a team to scope the project and create a solid project plan that can be followed during the course of our internship. On the right is a picture of us doing problem analysis in the office.
                           All the important questions like what is the problem, what can be done to solve it are answered in the project plan. Please refer to the project plan.

                            Once we knew what is the problem and its cause, we organized a brainstorm within labs(department within greenhouse) where all the interns along with our team leader participated and came up with really cool ideas. We first did a small presentation on what are we actually going to brainstorm about.
                            So we did not tell them our idea because we wanted them to keep an open mind during the brainstorm. The session was really interesting we divided people into groups of two and give 15 minutes to think of concepts. 

                            <br>
                            After the session we found some good insights on what can be made to achieve our goal, i.e.<br> <strong> To increase fan engagement at a personal level,</strong><br>
                            which were later discussed within my team and after selecting top two ideas they were presented to PSV, our Client.

                            After gathering all the insight from our brainstorm we had 8 different ideas, We made a matrix to choose the top two ideas. The matrix was based on requirement that needs to be fulfilled for Greenhouse, PSV and Fontys during the internship. Also we looked at pro's and con's of choosing each idea and finally came to a conclusion with top two ideas, And then later pitched these ideas to the client, in the next meeting.

                            <strong>Concept 1:</strong> personalized video messages in mail communication for newsletter subscribers. Newsletter subscribers receive a video message on their birthday from his / her favorite player wishing them a happy birthday. The idea is not that players will record about a thousand video messages every day, but that these can be generated automatically with the help of AI.

                            One of the available tools for this is Synthesia.io . With this we can make a digital clone of a player. All it takes is a 15 minute recording of the player in front of a green screen, and approximately 1 hour of voice recording in a studio. You can then generate input videos based on a simple text. See the video below for an example video we could send to a fan, featuring a PSV player in place of Synthesia's wife.

                           One problem that PSV raised during the first introductory meeting is that they currently have no customer service, so if a fan has a question about whether he can bring an umbrella into the stadium, for example, there is no place for him to get an answer. to that question. So here is a great opportunity for us to do something with this.
                       </p>
                       <p style="color:black;font-size:16px">
                           The idea is to use Synthesia.io to create a chatbot for the PSV site where fans can ask their questions. This will not be a regular chatbot that you type with, but a visual one that you talk to. You will not receive a typed message back, but you will see a player answer your question. You can think of it as live support of a digital clone of a player.
