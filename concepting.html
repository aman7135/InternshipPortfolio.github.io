                            Before we start thinking about possible concepts for our assignment, we first did a problem analysis with the developers team to find out what the core of the problem is, and what we want to solve with this project. Based on this analysis, we have made a list of topics we would like to learn more about. You can read more about research in the research report .

                            After the problem analysis, we organized a large brainstorm with all the people within Greenhouse Labs. We deliberately chose to involve people who are not in our project group, and who also know less about the assignment. Since we as a project group already had some ideas for concepts from the start, we got tunnel vision, which makes it difficult to come up with new ideas. With the help of the people outside our group we get fresh, new ideas.

                        <p style="color:black;font-size:16px">    
                            During the brainstorm, the group was split up into groups of 2 people, who all got a whiteboard on which they could write down ideas, without having to take into account the available time and budget, and that it was realized with Dynamic Audio. The problem situation we mentioned was: "How can we ensure that fans get a personal connection with PSV". After 15 minutes, we instructed everyone to think about how you can ensure that the ideas become realizable.Another 15 minutes later we gave everyone the assignment with a top 3 of the best ideas. At the end of the brainstorming session, everyone has shared their top 3 with each other. It was striking that quite often there were ideas that looked alike. The core of each idea was in direct interaction with one or more players.

                            After the brainstorming session, we sat together with the developer team to discuss the brainstorming results. We looked at the pros and cons of each idea, and combined ideas to come up with a great idea with the advantages of both sides. Ultimately, two ideas remained that I further developed into something visual to present to the customer.

                            The first concept is: personalized video messages in mail communication for newsletter subscribers. Newsletter subscribers receive a video message on their birthday from his / her favorite player wishing them a happy birthday. The idea is not that players will record about a thousand video messages every day, but that these can be generated automatically with the help of AI.

                            One of the available tools for this is Synthesia.io . With this we can make a digital clone of a player. All it takes is a 15 minute recording of the player in front of a green screen, and approximately 1 hour of voice recording in a studio. You can then generate input videos based on a simple text. See the video below for an example video we could send to a fan, featuring a PSV player in place of Synthesia's wife.

                           One problem that PSV raised during the first introductory meeting is that they currently have no customer service, so if a fan has a question about whether he can bring an umbrella into the stadium, for example, there is no place for him to get an answer. to that question. So here is a great opportunity for us to do something with this.
                       </p>
                       <p style="color:black;font-size:16px">
                           The idea is to use Synthesia.io to create a chatbot for the PSV site where fans can ask their questions. This will not be a regular chatbot that you type with, but a visual one that you talk to. You will not receive a typed message back, but you will see a player answer your question. You can think of it as live support of a digital clone of a player.
