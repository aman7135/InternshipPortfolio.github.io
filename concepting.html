                           In the first two weeks greenhouse gave me the opportunity to do a thorough analysis of the problem that PSV is facing, My team leader organized a situation complication workshop and then we worked on analyzing the problems and later presented the finding to other interns at the company. click on the button below to look at the situation complication Document. 
                           <br> Also we did a lot of problem analysis sessions together as a team to scope the project and create a solid project plan that can be followed during the course of our internship. On the right is a picture of us doing problem analysis in the office.
                           All the important questions like what is the problem, what can be done to solve it are answered in the project plan. Please refer to the project plan.

                            Once we knew what is the problem and its cause, we organized a brainstorm within labs(department within greenhouse) where all the interns along with our team leader participated and came up with really cool ideas. We first did a small presentation on what are we actually going to brainstorm about.
                            So we did not tell them our idea because we wanted them to keep an open mind during the brainstorm. The session was really interesting we divided people into groups of two and give 15 minutes to think of concepts. 

                            <br>
                            After the session we found some good insights on what can be made to achieve our goal, i.e.<br> <strong> To increase fan engagement at a personal level,</strong><br>
                            which were later discussed within my team and after selecting top two ideas they were presented to PSV, our Client.

                            After gathering all the insight from our brainstorm we had 8 different ideas, We made a matrix to choose the top two ideas. The matrix was based on requirement that needs to be fulfilled for Greenhouse, PSV and Fontys during the internship. Also we looked at pro's and con's of choosing each idea and finally came to a conclusion with top two ideas, And then later pitched these ideas to the client, in the next meeting.

                            <strong>Concept 1:</strong> The idea is to send PSV fan's a personalized video messages via email instead of a boring happy birthday email. Synthesia generates video using AI and it is the best solution as we only need utmost one hour of audio/video input and then we can send personalized messages to fans just by editing the script and creating a software that talks to Synthesia API then generate these videos automatically and finally send it to fans on their birthday. Here is a sample output we generated on <u>synthesia.io </u> to pitch it to PSV in the client meeting.
                            <br>
                            The output is very good and realistic, if you do not pay attention it is hard to believe that it is generated by AI.

                           <strong> Concept 2: </strong>AV customer chatbot on website, during our first meeting with PSV they mentioned that they lack power when it comes to answering general question from fans, they do not know who to contact for general questions like if you can bring an umbrella inside the stadium?
                           we see this as an opportunity, as it is a real problem and can be solved by something as simple as a conversational AI chat bot.
                      <br>
                           Again we propose to use Synthesia.io to create a chatbot for the PSV site where fans can ask their questions. 
                           Special thing about this chatbot is that it will be available as a voice chat bot, you can talk to this chatbot as a PSV fan or visitor on psv.nl. 
                           It not only answer your question but it can alo be in the voice of your favourite player.

                           As we meet with our client every three weeks, we pitched these two ideas to PSV in our next meeting, They really liked it and told us to research further with Synthesia and see how far we can go. 
                           We looked into all the possibilities, costs and feasibility and the results were disappointing, we were not able to create more than 200 videos even after the subscription costs, we looked into some work round as well but nothing helped much so finally we came to the conclusion that we have to change our concept, it is not possible to move further with the voice cloning project.
                           <br>
                           Keeping that in mind we did a brainstorm again as a team on what can be done while keeping the core idea of the project same.

            <h1><strong>Change of Plans</strong></h1>
            <p>In our research we realized that it was not possible to create a dutch voice clone given the constraints, so we tweaked our plans bit, keeping the core of the project same</p>

                   <p style="color:black;font-size:16px">
                          Our main goal was to send fans personalized video messages so that they feel connected to the brand, to the players, It is possible to crate the same connection using Google home audio. More than 5% of the dutch household gained access according to our first brand research. It will be a wise option to include Google home and leave the personalization part to Google text to speech, We have done research in that area and it is possible to use Google TTs to create personalized audio output. <br> Using this concept we can record a video with the PSV player and then we can combine that video with different audio output personlised for each fan and edit them together then finally host it somewhere and send it to the fans via email
                          Here is how the concept looks like:
                          <ol start="1" >
                                <li> <strong>Player:</strong> wakes up and talk to google home </li>
                                <li><strong>Google:</strong> Hey it's X's birthday today, Wish him a happy birthday</li>
                                <li><strong>Player:</strong> checks his calendar in phone</li>
                                <li><strong>Phone:</strong> show's X's name on screen in calendar</li>
                                <li><strong>Player:</strong> Wishes happy birthday (non personalised)</li>
                                <li><strong>Player:</strong> Shows the voucher code</li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>

                          <p style="color:black;font-size:16px">
                            Here is a story board to understand the idea completely, All the story boards are made by Niek, My teammate, as he specializes in media design. It helped us a lot every time we wanted to pitch an idea as the story board makes things clear easily.

                          After proposing the Idea to PSV some people from their team did not like it and immediately refused the idea, And then they came up with a concept of a person calling the player reminding him that it is person X's birthday.

                          The previous concept with a phone call was good but, the audio was still robotic and it is obvious that the player is talking to a robot, and that is something We do not want. So after a long discussion with PSV we came to a final conclusion and this time it was FINAL. 
                          <br>
                          We told PSV to look at the Google home concept one more time and maybe change th script according to them however they like, It is impossible to make Google home sound realistic. So this time we gave them time to come up with a concept that includes Google home voice. Finally they were happy with the concept and provided us with following script
                          <ol start="1" >
                                <li> <strong>Player:</strong> while driving, ask Google about his agenda </li>

                                <li><strong>Player:</strong> walks to the stadium and points to LED boarding</li>
                                <li><strong>Led Board:</strong> shows "HAPPY BIRTHDAY message" personalized </li>
                             
                            </ol>
                          This was given by PSV and as it does not change anything for implementation we agreed to the concept so that we can finally continue with our development and create a Hi-Fi prototype during our internship. 
                          <br>
                          It is not possible to shoot actual video with real player as they are not available in January so we already shot a placeholder video, this time with Mathijs as the message is supposed to be in dutch.

                            As always we made a story board to make things clear to everyone, who is remotely attached to the project.

                            We will focus on building an application prototype that send personalized video messages to fans on their birthday from the PSV data base.
                            <br>
                            Personalized video is a render of previously shot video of a PSV player in the stadium asking Google about his agenda and pointing toward the LED board in the stadium.
                            <br>
                            Our software will automatically create TTS audio including the names of fans and their age and then edit this with the pre recorded video then render the video, host it on Vimeo, and finally send video link to all the fans on the date of their birthday.
