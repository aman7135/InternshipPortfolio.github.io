                The development of the project started from first week, we continued building prototypes until we finalized a concept.

                            Project plan was changed quite a lot of time as it took long time to finalize the concept, Here is the latest <a target="blank" href="documents/project_plan.pdf">Project plan.</a>

                            We came across deep fake technology during our research. It is possible to create deep fakes as shown in the video. As we were already working on voice cloning our team leader told us to combine the two and build an internal video for Greenhouse. On right is the video where we cloned the voice of one of the famous employees of Greenhouse and deep faked his face as the King of the Netherlands. The audio and video has been combined manually in Premiere Pro. The voice clone has been generated by me using Tacotron as shown in research. This voice has been clone just wit % seconds of Audio input which is one of the main highlights of Tacotron. Rest the deep fake video itself has been created by my teammate Niek. 
                            <br><br>
                            The result are not great, even they are below average but it was cool technology to interact with as a part of our research. And the video was shared withing the company and we got a lot of applause from everyone including our team leader.

                        <p style="color:black;font-size:16px">
                            At one point of time on our research we realized that voice cloning will be really difficult to implement as the technology which can clone a realistic sounding output voice with only 2 hours of input audio is not available yet.
                            So we looked into a non Dynamic audio solution The idea is to record the original audio message, ages number between from 1-100, and weather types like sunny, rainy fog etc and record then 200-300 names which will cover 60-70% of PSV's data base and then morph them together to send a personalized message.<br>
                        </p>
                        <strong> We personalize the message with 4 factors:</strong>
                            <ol start="1">
                            <li><STRONG>Name:</STRONG> Name of the Fan</li>
                            <li><STRONG>Age:</STRONG> current age of Fan </li>
                            <li><STRONG>City:</STRONG> The city he lives in according to PSV's Database</li>
                            <li><STRONG>Weather:</STRONG> Current weather in the Fan's city</li>  
                        </ol>
                       <p style="color:black;font-size:16px">
                            It looks really promising as we have all his information and we can easily calculate his age and find out the Weather in the city. For getting the weather I used openWeather API and  which give me lot of weather details for the given city that can be used in the output Audio.
                        Here is an example output audio of the prototype. It was built by myself and Niek where Niek focused on the Audio part and I mainly focused on weather aspect.

                            As email does not support video attachment it was a challenge for me to find some hosting platform where I can host the videos either free of cost or at minimal cost. I talk more about this in the <a target="blank" href="research.html">Research section</a>. YouTube was the first option that came to my mind and fortunately there is an API available to upload the video. 
                            <br>
                            As the whole process from combining video to sending the email is automated, video upload needs to be done automatically. And for that I created a prototype that shows that it is possible to upload videos to YouTube using Google developers API. <br>
                            The process was simple enough I had to register myself as a developer in Google console website and create an application which gave me my API credentials i.e. Client ID and Client Secret.
                            On your right is a sample screenshot of my YouTube channel, This video is uploaded via API using the prototype I built, And as you can see it is scheduled for a given date and time which is one of our major requirements.

He created a script that gets input from our prototype and combine audio samples with the raw video and finally render a personalized video. This sample prototype is working and we are able to render video automatically, but this part was not my specialty as I was looking more into other 3 main parts i.e. TTS, Hosting and PSV Database.

                            For hosting we are using Vimeo Business Plan which gives us 5 TB of Monthly hosting space on cloud and also their is an API available to upload the videos. 
                            In the prototype I built a functionality that uploads the videos to the business account, using Vimeo's API. It is possible to fetch the rendered video from location then upload it to Vimeo and finally receive the link where the video is hosted.<br>
                            I was completely responsible for this part and everything was done by me individually.

                    Right now we have all the things working, but separately and we are working on developing the final Hi-Fi prototype which will be presented in the final presentation during the assessment at school and at the office.

                            Building prototypes was a fun process, but I wish we had much time for testing purposes, as we are already done with our internship we did not get any chance to test our product, although we did tested what we have with sample users to make sure we are on the right track. Here are some challenges that I faced during the project:
                        </p>        
                        <p style="color:black;font-size:14px"> 
                            <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Client:</strong> We had very good communication with our client, but it was difficult to make them happy, As a result it took long time to come to a conclusion and we entered the development phase late in mid-December</li>
                                        <li><strong>Technology: </strong>We explored a lot of technologies, but to satisfy the requirement of voice cloning with recording time constraints, It ws just not possible to develop a voice clone and we had to move to a different concept.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Work from Home:</strong> Due to corona virus we had were forced to work from home, My home Office is not as good a sthe office so it was a bit challenging to do everything from home.
                                        </li>
                                        <li><strong>Costs:</strong> Cost was a big factor, we had to find the cepaest solution, and cheapest is not always the best. We had to discrd some really cool ideas because of cost.
                                        </li>
                                        
                                    </ul>
